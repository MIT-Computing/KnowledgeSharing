# Poisson Equation Solver

This repository contains a Python script for solving the Poisson equation using the finite difference method.

## Description

The Poisson equation is a partial differential equation of the form:

<p align="center">
    $\nabla^2u=f$
</p>
In this script, we solve the Poisson equation in a 2D domain using the finite difference method.

## Installation

To use this script, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You also need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using the following commands:

pip install numpy
pip install matlotlib


## Usage

To run the script, navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command:

python3 main.py


This will solve the Poisson equation and display the results in a 3D plot.
